# wx-historical

This "wx" script was apparently written by Peter St. Wecker originally in 1992.  I
encountered it sometime during my time at the University of Alaska Fairbanks
in the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF-Lab), a collection of NeXT
workstations.

As the download server no longer exists, this script no longer works.  It is
preserved here only as a historical curiosity.
